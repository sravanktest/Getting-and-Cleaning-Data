# Code Book

This code book describes the variables, the data, and transformations performed to clean up the data.

# Data & Transformations

* The data is collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
* A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
* Data was extracted and transformed to create tidy dataset. 
* The data was aggregated to get the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
* The tidy data set is located in this repo with name "tidydata_uci.txt"

# Variables
The dataset has two identifiers "subject" and "activity".
* subject - Data is collected from 30 subjects. Subjects are identified as 1 to 30
* activity - activity labels are WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

Below are additional variables that are measure of different features.
